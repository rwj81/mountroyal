              Arriving by air: If you are arriving by air, you will receive a <a href="https://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/travel-voyage/ivc-rnc-eng.html#card" target="_blank" >CBSA Declaration Card</a> while you are onboard your flight. You must complete it before arriving in Canada. For a step-by-step guide, consult <a href="https://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/travel-voyage/aba-apa-eng.html" target="_blank" >Arriving by Air</a>.

            <p>Montréal–Trudeau provides border preclearance for passengers bound for the United States. This means that you will be screened by a U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officer before departure, and will not have to submit to any other formalities when arriving in the United States.</p>
              <br />
            <p>You must have all the required documentation with you, including a valid passport. Note also that you cannot take certain products, such as fruit from other countries, into the United States.</p>
              <br />
            <p>NOTE: Canadian and U.S. passport holders can now use the <a href="https://www.cbp.gov/travel/us-citizens/apc" target="_blank" >Automated Passport Control</a> kiosks to save time. The new process involves four steps:</p>
              <li>
                Scan your passport;
              </li>
              <li>
                Have your photo taken;
              </li>
              <li>
                Answer the questions on the screen;
              </li>
              <li>
                Present your documents to the CBP officer.
              </li>
